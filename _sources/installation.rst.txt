Installing PyOP2
================

PyOP2 requires Python 3.6 or later.

The main testing platform for PyOP2 is Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit with Python
3.6. Later Ubuntu versions should also work. Some users successfully
use PyOP2 on Mac OS X.

Installation of the dependencies is somewhat involved, and therefore
the recommended way to obtain PyOP2 is by using the `Firedrake
installation script
<https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html>`__.  This will give
you a Python 3 venv that contains a working PyOP2 installation.
