    This will instantiate an object of the correct type for the
    currently selected backend.  Use this over simple object
    instantiation if you want a generic superclass method to
    instantiate objects that at runtime should be of the correct
    backend type.

    As an example, let's say we want a method to zero a :class:`Dat`.
    This will look the same on all backends::

      def zero(self):
          ParLoop(self._zero_kernel, self.dataset,
                  self(IdentityMap, WRITE)).compute()

    but if we place this in a base class, then the :class:`ParLoop`
    object we instantiate is a base `ParLoop`, rather than (if we're
    on the sequential backend) a sequential `ParLoop`.  Instead, you
    should do this::

      def zero(self):
          _make_object('ParLoop', self._zero_kernel, self.dataset,
                       self(IdentityMap, WRITE)).compute()

    That way, the correct type of `ParLoop` will be instantiated at
    runtime."""
