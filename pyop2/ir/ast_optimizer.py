    * Loop Invariant Code Motion (LICM)
      Backend compilers apply LICM to innermost loops only. In addition,
      hoisted expressions are usually not vectorized. Here, we apply LICM to
      terms which are known to be constant (i.e. they are declared const)
      and all of the loops in the nest are searched for sub-expressions
      involving such const terms only. Also, hoisted terms are wrapped
      within loops to exploit compiler autovectorization. This has proved to
      be beneficial for loop nests in which the bounds of all loops are
      relatively small (let's say less than 50-60).

    * register tiling:
      Given a rectangular iteration space, register tiling slices it into
      square tiles of user-provided size, with the aim of improving register
      pressure and register re-use."""
