    """Invocation of an OP2 kernel

    :arg kernel: The :class:`Kernel` to be executed.
    :arg it_space: The iteration space over which the kernel should be executed. The primary iteration space will be a :class:`Set`. If a local iteration space is required, then this can be provided in brackets. The local iteration space may be either rank-1 or rank-2. For example, to iterate over a :class:`Set` named ``elements`` assembling a 3x3 local matrix at each entry, the ``it_space`` argument should be ``elements(3,3)``. To iterate over ``elements`` assembling a dimension-3 local vector at each entry, the ``it_space`` argument should be ``elements(3)``.
    :arg \*args: One or more objects of type :class:`Global`, :class:`Dat` or :class:`Mat` which are the global data structures from and to which the kernel will read and write.

    ``par_loop`` invocation is illustrated by the following example::

      pyop2.par_loop(mass, elements(3,3),
             mat((elem_node[pyop2.i[0]]), elem_node[pyop2.i[1]]), pyop2.INC),
             coords(elem_node, pyop2.READ))

    This example will execute the :class:`Kernel` ``mass`` over the
    :class:`Set` ``elements`` executing 3x3 times for each
    :class:`Set` member. The :class:`Kernel` takes four arguments, the
    first is a :class:`Mat` named ``mat``, the second is a field named
    `coords`. The remaining two arguments indicate which local
    iteration space point the kernel is to execute.

    A :class:`Mat` requires a pair of :class:`Map` objects, one each
    for the row and column spaces. In this case both are the same
    ``elem_node`` map. The row :class:`Map` is indexed by the first
    index in the local iteration space, indicated by the ``0`` index
    to :data:`pyop2.i`, while the column space is indexed by
    the second local index.  The matrix is accessed to increment
    values using the ``pyop2.INC`` access descriptor.

    The ``coords`` :class:`Dat` is also accessed via the ``elem_node``
    :class:`Map`, however no indices are passed so all entries of
    ``elem_node`` for the relevant member of ``elements`` will be
    passed to the kernel as a vector.
