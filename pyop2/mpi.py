# These are user-level communicators, we never send any messages on
# them inside PyOP2.
COMM_WORLD = PETSc.COMM_WORLD.tompi4py()

COMM_SELF = PETSc.COMM_SELF.tompi4py()

# Exposition:
#
# To avoid PyOP2 library messages interfering with messages that the
# user might send on communicators, we duplicate any communicator
# passed in to PyOP2 and send our messages on this internal
# communicator.  This is equivalent to the way PETSc does things.
#
# To avoid unnecessarily duplicating communicators that we've already
# seen, we store information on both the inner and the outer
# communicator using MPI attributes, including a refcount.
#
# The references are as follows:
#
#     .-----------.       .------------.
#     |           |--->---|            |       .----------.
#     | User-Comm |       | PyOP2-Comm |--->---| Refcount |
#     |           |---<---|            |       '----------'
#     '-----------'       '------------'
#
# When we're asked to duplicate a communicator, we first check if it
# has a refcount (therefore it's a PyOP2 comm).  In which case we
# increment the refcount and return it.
#
# If it's not a PyOP2 comm, we check if it has an embedded PyOP2 comm,
# pull that out, increment the refcount and return it.
#
# If we've never seen this communicator before, we MPI_Comm_dup it,
# and set up the references with an initial refcount of 1.
#
# This is all handled in dup_comm.
#
# The matching free_comm is used to decrement the refcount on a
# duplicated communicator, eventually calling MPI_Comm_free when that
# refcount hits 0.  This is necessary since a design decision in
# mpi4py means that the user is responsible for calling MPI_Comm_free
# on any dupped communicators (rather than relying on the garbage collector).
#
# Finally, since it's difficult to know when all these communicators
# go out of scope, we register an atexit handler to clean up any
# outstanding duplicated communicators.
